# 📊 Data-science-projects

Collection of my data science projects

## 📋 Overview

This repository was created as a way to learn and understand different concepts that are useful in data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence (AI). It focuses on applying many techniques and methods to solve different real-world problems. 

These projects include includes codes, visualizations, explanaitions and in some cases, reports.

## 🧠 Key Concepts

- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Supervised learning
- Machine learning
- Topological Data Analysis (TDA)
- Artificial Neural Networks 


## 📖 Databases

Each project contains a description from where the data was obtained, the most common repositories are:

- [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)
- [UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/)
